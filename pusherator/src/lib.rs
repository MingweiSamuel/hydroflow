#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]

//! Combinators for working with push-based iterators.
//!
//! These are grouped into several modules:
//! * [`pusherator`] - push-equivalent to [`Iterator`]s, synchronous.
//! * ['sink`] - push-equivalent to [`Stream`](futures::stream::Stream)s, asynchronous, as provided by [`futures`].
//! * [`sinkerator`] - asynchronous hybrid of pusherators and sinks, lighter weight than the [`Sink`](futures::sink::Sink) interface.
