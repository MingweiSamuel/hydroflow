<!-- GENERATED BY `"hydroflow_lang/src/graph/ops/filter.rs"`, DO NOT EDIT -->
Filter outputs a subsequence of the items it receives at its input, according to a
Rust boolean closure passed in as an argument.

> TODO: Why does filter's closure expect a reference and other ops like map do not?

```rust
# let mut __hf = hydroflow::hydroflow_syntax! {
recv_iter(vec!["hello", "world"]) -> filter(|&x| x == "hello")
    -> for_each(|x| println!("{}", x));
# };
# __hf.run_available();
```
