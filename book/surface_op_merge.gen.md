> *n* input streams of the same type, 1 output stream of the same type

Merges an arbitrary number of input streams into a single stream. Each input sequence is a subsequence of the output, but no guarantee is given on how the inputs are interleaved.

Since `merge` has multiple input streams, it needs to be assigned to
a variable to reference its multiple input ports across statements.

```rust
# let mut __hf = hydroflow::hydroflow_syntax! {
my_merge = merge();
recv_iter(vec!["hello", "world"]) -> [0]my_merge;
recv_iter(vec!["stay", "gold"]) -> [1]my_merge;
recv_iter(vec!["don\'t", "give", "up"]) -> [2]my_merge;
my_merge -> map(|x| x.to_uppercase())
    -> for_each(|x| println!("{}", x));
# };
# __hf.run_available();
```
